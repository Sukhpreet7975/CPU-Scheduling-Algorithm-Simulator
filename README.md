# üñ•Ô∏è CPU Scheduling Algorithm Simulator üìä

A web-based, interactive simulator designed to visualize and compare common CPU scheduling algorithms. This tool helps users understand the behavior and performance implications of techniques like FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Priority (Non-Preemptive & Preemptive), and Round Robin. It's built entirely with client-side HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

This project is a client-side application and requires no special installation steps beyond a modern web browser.

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the ZIP):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sukhpreet7975/CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm-Simulator.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm-Simulator
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser:**
    *   You can usually do this by double-clicking the `index.html` file.
    *   Alternatively, for a better experience (especially if you plan to make changes), you can use a simple HTTP server. If you have Python installed:
        *   Python 3: `python -m http.server`
        *   Python 2: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
        Then open `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified) in your browser. Many code editors (like VS Code with the "Live Server" extension) also offer this functionality.

## üöÄ Usage

### ‚å®Ô∏è Inputting Processes

1.  **Number of Processes:** Enter the desired number of processes in the "Number of Processes" field.
2.  **Generate Fields:** Click the "Generate Fields" button. This will create input rows for each process.
    *   The fields will be auto-populated with random values for Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority.
3.  **Customize (Optional):** You can manually change the auto-generated values for Arrival, Burst (CPU/IO sequence), and Priority for each process.
4.  **Context Switch Time:** Enter the desired overhead for context switches.

### üñ±Ô∏è Selecting an Algorithm

1.  Use the "Algorithm" dropdown menu to select the scheduling algorithm you want to simulate (e.g., FCFS, SJF, RR).
2.  **Time Quantum (for Round Robin):** If you select "Round Robin (RR)", an input field for "Time Quantum" will appear. Enter the desired time slice value.

### üéõÔ∏è Simulation Controls

*   **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Play:** Starts or resumes the simulation.
*   **‚è∏Ô∏è Pause:** Pauses the currently running simulation.
*   **‚èπÔ∏è Reset:** Stops the simulation, clears all results and the Gantt chart, and resets the processes to their initial state, ready for a new run.
*   **Speed Slider:** Adjust the slider to control the speed of the simulation (milliseconds per step). Slower speeds make it easier to observe step-by-step execution.

### üîç Understanding the Output

*   **Status Message:** Provides feedback on the simulation's state or any input errors.
*   **Process Details Table:** Displays PID, Arrival, Burst, Priority, Status, Wait, TAT, Response, and Completion time for each process.
*   **Averages:** Displays the average Waiting Time, Turnaround Time, Response Time, and Throughput.
*   **Gantt Chart:** Visually shows process execution, idle times, and context switches (CS).
*   **System Monitor:**
    *   **CPU & Memory Utilization:** Live progress bars.
    *   **Current Time:** The simulation's internal clock.
    *   **Ready Queue:** Lists PIDs of processes ready for the CPU.
    *   **Execution Trace:** A step-by-step log of scheduler decisions.
